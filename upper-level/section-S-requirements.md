## Problem

1. An autonomous area is required for split residents to dine separately
2. Inequity will arise if there are differences in size, quality and positioning between upper and lower levels


## Solution

1. Locate dining room in Section S because of the following principles:
    * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
        - Travel in serving and cleaning up after a meals
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
        - Dining areas tend to be under utilised but can share their space with the lounge
2. Choose window positions & sizes that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
        - West facing windows invite a lot of heat/sun
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Externally matches the rest of the build structures
    4. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
        - External window cleaning will rarely occur
