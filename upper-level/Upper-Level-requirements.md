# Upper-Level Requirements

The Upper-Level refers to the new building structure that has been inserted between the lower-level and the roof of the original building.

With the lower-level requirements the scope was defined as the gap between the AS-IS model and the TO-BE model. With the upper-level requirements there is no existing building structure state, therefore the entire model and requiements is the scope.

To avoid confusion of room names with the lower-level, new section group names have been assigned as the basis of organising these requirements. The sections will again continue in alphabetical order starting from 'M'.

## Symmetry
Figure UL1 outlines the general wall sectioning of the upper level. To a great extent there is intentional architectural symmetry with the lower-level. That is, most room configurations are mirrored in size, position and characteristics of its lower-level counterpart. In terms of personal space both levels occupy the same total surface area, thus making each level equally equitable for future tenants/families to split in order to cohabit the dwelling.
