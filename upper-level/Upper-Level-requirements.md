# Upper-Level Requirements

The Upper-Level refers to the new building structure that has been inserted between the lower-level and the roof of the original building.

With the lower-level requirements the scope was defined as the gap between the Actual view and the Expected view. With the upper-level requirements there is no existing building structure state, therefore all views and requirements form the the scope.

To avoid confusion of room names with the lower-level, new section labels have been assigned as the basis of organising these requirements. The sections will again continue in alphabetical order this time starting from 'M'.
