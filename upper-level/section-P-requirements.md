# Section P - Study [Shared Resource]

## Context

Section P will be the study which is a shared resource. The study is located beside the multi-level stair case on the upper level.

The study is designed to be an open space. It will likely host a printer,  filing cabinet and will likely require powering a number of devices. People should be able to work together around a table

## Problem

1. Both upper & lower level residents require an area for accessing shared electrical devices, hot desking and file storage


## Solution

1. Locate study in Section P because of the following principles:
    * Centralise shared building services/resources
        - Equally accessible for all residents and visitors
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
        - Its expected that this is a highly transitive area
    * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
        - Close proximity to bedrooms and main entrance
2. Choose window position & size that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
        - West facing windows invite a lot of heat/sun
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Externally matches the rest of the build structures
    4. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
        - External window cleaning will rarely occur
