# Section P - Study [Shared Resource]

## Context

Section P will be the study which is a shared resource. The study is located beside the multi-level stair case on the upper level.

The study is designed to be an open space. 

* It will likely host a printer, filing cabinet and will likely require powering a number of devices
* People should be able to work together around a table
* The west facing windows if installed can invite a lot of heat and light

## Problem

1. Both upper & lower level residents require an area for accessing shared electrical devices, hot desking and file storage


## Requirements

|ID|Description|Est. Cost|Alternative Solution Cost|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|LLP-REQ1|The study shall have an appropriate number of power outlets installed on the north east, north west and east walls|||
|LLP-REQ2|The study shall have an appropriate number of LED downlights|||
|LLP-REQ3|The study shall be carpeted|||
|LLP-REQ4**|The study shall be connected to the ducted heating|||
|LLP-REQ5|The study shall have an appropriately sized double glazed window|||
|LLP-REQ6|The study window shall be able to be opened for ventilation|||
|LLP-REQ7|The study window shall have a fly screen to keep the insects out|||
|LLP-REQ8|The study shall have a fitted night/day internal roller blind with sun/heat block|||


## Solution

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems|
|Centralise shared building services/resources|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
