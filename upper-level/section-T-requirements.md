## Problem

1. An autonomous area is required for split residents to entertain separately
2. Inequity will arise if there are differences in size, quality and positioning between upper and lower levels


## Solution

1. Locate lounge room in Section T because of the following principles:
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
        - Lounge areas are often highly utilised areas in the house
    * Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
        - Lounge areas can pull in the space and resources of the dining area
    * Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Equally equitable whether on the upper or lower levels
2. Choose window positions & sizes that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
        - West facing windows invite a lot of heat/sun
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Externally matches the rest of the build structures
    4. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
        - External window cleaning will rarely occur
