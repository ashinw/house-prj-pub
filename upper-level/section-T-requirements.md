|Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
