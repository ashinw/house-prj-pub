## Problem

1. Longevity and resale value will be impacted if there are less than three rooms
2. Inequity will arise if there are differences in size, quality and positioning between upper and lower levels

## Solution

1. Locate 2nd bedroom in Section Q because of the following principles:
    * Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Equally equitable whether on the upper or lower levels
    * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
        - Close proximity to all resources
    * Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
        - Close proximity to stairs, and bathroom
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
2. Choose appliances and fixtures that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Symmetry with split occupancy 
        - Same quality and fittings whether on upper or lower levels 
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
        - External window cleaning will rarely occur
