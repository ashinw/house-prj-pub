## Problem

1. An autonomous bathroom is required for split level residents and their guests
2. The Symmetry principle will be violated because the laundry must be placed in this same position on the lower level 


## Solution

1. Locate main bathroom in section M because of the following principles:
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
    * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
        - Close proximity to all bedrooms
2. Choose appliances and fixtures that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Symmetry with split occupancy 
        - Same quality and fittings whether on upper or lower levels 
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
        - External window cleaning will rarely occur
