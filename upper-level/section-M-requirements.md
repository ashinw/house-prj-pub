## Problem

1. The Symmetry principle has been violated because the laundry must be placed in this position on the lower level 


## Solution

1. Locate main bathroom in section M because of the following principles:
  * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
  * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
2. Choose appliances and fixtures that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Symmetry with split occupancy 
      * Both lower & upper should have the same quality and fittings
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
