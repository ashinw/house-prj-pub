# Outer-building Requirements

The outer-building refers to the external building structure.

These requirements typically cross cut different sections from the upper & lower levels and are therefore better modeled in a three dimension (ie. 3D) plane. Hence, the final sections X, Y & Z are all in reference to the 3D axis.

|Section Group|Dimension|Compass direction|
|:---|:---|:---|
|[Section X](./section-X-requirements.md)|X-axis|east facing west & west facing east|
|[Section Y](./section-Y-requirements.md)|Y-axis|north facing south & south facing north|
|[Section Z](./section-Z-requirements.md)|Z-axis|Top facing bottom|
