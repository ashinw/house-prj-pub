## Problem

1. The old 70's building facade needs a contemporary refresh that achieves a balanced fusion of the classic and modern styles
2. Changing the window wall openings sizes will increase the build cost
3. New windows on the upper rooms must avoid an external jarring effect. Further a balance of symmetry and asymmetry for features effect
4. Flat foam insulated cladding has been used to achieve a modern effect
5. Multiple rendered color schemes have been used to achieve greater consistency with other building sides where the removed windows/doors have been filled in with cladding
