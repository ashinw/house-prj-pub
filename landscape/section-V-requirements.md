Figure LS2: Expected landscape

There is/are currently:
* A driveway
* A garden bed by the footpath
* A garden bed in front of the verandah
* A footpath leading to the front stair case and steps 


## Problem
1. There is a slope from driveway to the front of the house
2. There is no garage and the car port driveway entry is too narrow for a standard modern vehicle
3. Our smaller vehicle is almost always street parked which means groceries have to carried further after a shopping run
4. Parking on the grass area to the east of the house frequently creates skid marks and a lot of mud due to a lot of water retention on the soils surface 


## Solution

1. Landscape the east frontyard to accomodate vehicle parking
