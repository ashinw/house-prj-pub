![TO-BE landscape diagram](Landscape-TO-BE.svg)

Figure LS2: Expected landscape

There is/are currently:
* A clothes line
* A shed
* A car port
* The remainder of an old backyard & car port gate


## Problem
1. There is a slope from the east neighbour's fence line to the west neighbour's fence line
2. The shed is small and has a broken door
3. The open car port has rusted gutters 
4. There is a stump north of the shed unnecessarily occupying space
5. There is a tree and bushes along the north west fence line that indirectly affect clothes on the line by visiting birds
6. There is a lack of storage space in the house
7. There is no privacy in the backyard

|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|

### Steps

Landscape the north backyard and make it more fit for purpose with better space utilisation
1. Remove stump, tree and remaining bushes along the north west fence line
2. Flatten the area in preperation for the north backyard concreting
3. To accomodate a larger shed extend the concrete slab to the north of the fence lines using standard concrete Area = 8.4m^2
4. Concrete north backyard with exposed [aggregate concrete](#References) #1 Area = 48m^2
5. Install steps down from laundry
6. Replace shed with [larger shed](#References) #2
7. Repair/replace the car port's rusted gutters
8. Install car port entrance [corrogated gate](#References) #3 into backyard


### Considerations

* Aggregate concrete is better value for money over other outdoor flooring solutions
* The tree drops a lot of foliage and attracts many birds
* Aggregate concrete has little/no maintenance 
* The larger shed will still be in close proximity of the back door for moving things in and out of storage
