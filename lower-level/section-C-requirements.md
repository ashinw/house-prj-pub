* Broken door stopper

Note, my 84 year old dad will be moving into this room and we wanted to ensure that he was given a modern room with comforts


## Problem

1. The wardrobe is built into the wall and is bulky with unnecessary plasterboard covering access
2. The wardrobe sliders are very heavy and keep jumping off their rails
3. The wardrobe draws are overly worn and no longer stay on their rails
4. The wardrobe plastic shelve coverings have fallen off 
5. There is no cooling system in this room
6. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
7. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate


## Solution

1. Renew the entire master bedroom and make it identical to the corresponding Upper Level master bedroom
