# Section C - Master bedroom

## Context

Section C remains as the master bedroom on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Three downlights installed centrally
* An extra unused switch on the wall entrance to the ensuite for the exhaust fan
* A broken door stopper
* A ducted heating vent beside the east window  
* An external window blind to the east of the window
* Sheer and bulky pinch pleated curtains with thermo insulation lining
* An active UHF TV antenna port on the south east corner wall by the wardrobe is connected to the external antenna


## Problem

1. The wardrobe is built into the wall and is bulky with unnecessary plasterboard coverings
2. The wardrobe sliders are very heavy and keep jumping off their rails
3. The wardrobe draws are overly worn and no longer stay on their rails
4. The wardrobe plastic shelve coverings have fallen off 
5. There is no cooling system in this room
6. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
7. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate

Note, although the master bedroom will remain the same size, the furnishing sizes may vary and they need not remain the same (eg. window frame size or wardrobe)

### Steps
1. Refurbish master bedroom in line with upper-level and the rest of the house  

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|

### Considerations

1. LLC-REQ6 & LLC-REQ9
    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected
