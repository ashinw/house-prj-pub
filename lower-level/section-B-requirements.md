# Section B

## Context

Section B remains as the Master bedroom's ensuite in the lower level as per the original floor plan.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: TO-BE lower-level sections

There is/are:
* An exhaust fan with 4 heat lamps and a central LED built in
* A single downlight  

Note, my 84 year old dad will be moving into this room and we wanted to ensure that he was given new furnishings and comfort


## Problem

1. The ensuite is old and has had mold on the ceiling
2. There is no ducted heating outlet installed and heating is achieved using an electric heater and/or the exhaust fan's heat lamps
3. The sliding door constantly bumps up against the inner enclosure when the wind blows


## Solution

1. Renew the entire ensuite and make it identical to the corresponding Upper Level ensuite
