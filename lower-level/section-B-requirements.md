# Section B - Ensuite for the master bedroom

## Context

Section B remains as the master bedroom's ensuite on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* An exhaust fan with 4 heat lamps and a central LED bulb built in
* A single LED downlight  
* A set of fixtures: shower, toilet, sink, cabinet & mirror
* The floor is currently tiled  


## Problem

1. The ensuite is old and has had mold on the ceiling
2. There is no ducted heating outlet installed and heating is achieved using an electric heater and/or the exhaust fan's heat lamps
3. The sliding door constantly bumps up against the inner enclosure when the wind blows
4. Inequity will arise if there are differences in size, quality and positioning between upper and lower levels


## Solution

1. Keep ensuite in Section B because of the following principles:
    * Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
        - Minimising structural changes will reduce costs
    * Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Equal equity whether on upper or lower levels
    * Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
        - Ensuite is expected to reside adjoining master bedroom
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
2. Choose appliances and fixtures that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Symmetry with split occupancy 
        - Same quality and fittings whether on upper or lower levels 
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
