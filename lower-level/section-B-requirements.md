# Section B

## Context
Section B remains as the Master Bedroom's ensuite in the lower level as per the original floor plan.

## Problem
1. My 84 year old dad will be moving into this room and we wanted to ensure that he was given new furnishings 
2. The ensuite is old and has had mold on the ceiling
3. There is no ducted heating outlet installed and heating is achieved using an electric heater and/or the exhaust fan's heat lamp

## Solution
1. Renew the entire ensuite and make it identical to the corresponding Upper Level ensuite
