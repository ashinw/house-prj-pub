# Section B - Ensuite for the master bedroom

## Context

Section B remains as the master bedroom's ensuite on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* An exhaust fan with 4 heat lamps and a central LED bulb built in
* A single LED downlight  
* A set of fixtures: shower, toilet, sink, vanity cabinet & mirror, towel rails x2, hand towel rail
* A tiled floor   


## Problem

1. The ensuite is old and has had mold on the ceiling
2. There is no ducted heating outlet installed and heating is achieved using an electric heater and/or the exhaust fan's heat lamps
3. The sliding door constantly bumps up against the inner enclosure when the wind blows

Table LL-B1: Floor plan comparison

Note, although the ensuite room will remain the same size, the furnishing sizes may vary and do not need to remain the same (eg. corner vanity is not a requirements)

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|Fixtures and furnishings value function over form|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|

### Steps

1. Refurbish ensuite in line with upper level and rest of house
2. Repair the in-wall sliding door to make the same as the upper-level

### Considerations

1. LLB-REQ9 & LLB-REQ13
    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected


## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLB-ISS-1|The bathroom is prone to accumulating mold on the ceiling||
|LLB-ISS-2|The current exhaust fan with a slightly open window is not very effective at removing the mist after a hot shower||
