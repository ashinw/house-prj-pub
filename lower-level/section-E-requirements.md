# Section E - 2nd Bedroom

## Context

Section E was originally a large study which was the same size as the 1st bedroom (Section G). It will now become the 2nd bedroom on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* A sky-light installed outside the east wall
* Two downlights were specifically positioned for the two side by side tables located against the south wall because it was a home office
* A ducted heating vent beside the east window
* An external window blind to the east of the window
* Sheer and freyed pinch pleated curtains with no thermo insulation lining


## Problem

1. This room can get very hot from the morning summer sun from the east 
2. There is no wardrobe 
3. There is no cooling system in this room
4. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
5. All technology related wiring originated from here because it was a home office
6. Water has damaged some of the ceiling plaster board on the west side via the sky-light
6. There are printer ink stains on the carpet
7. The curtains are broken and cumbersome to operate

Note, although the bedroom will remain the same size, the furnishing sizes may vary and they need not remain the same (eg. window frame size & position of the downlights)

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|
