# Section J

## Context

Section J still is the dining area in the lower level as per the original floor plan.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: TO-BE lower-level sections

There is/are:
* Two LED downlights installed operating from a dimmer transformer
* Small wall air-conditioner installed on the upper right corner of the west wall
* A sliding door to the kitchen 
* A staircase down to the rumpus/meditaton room
* An outside hatch door for under house access


## Problem

1. The wall air-conditioner is old, highly inefficient and only capable of cooling a small area. When turned on the generated cool air moves its way down to the rumpus/meditation room 
2. There is a 2x2m water stain on the carpet near the north sliding door entrance to the kitchen
3. The ceiling plaster board is damaged by the leaky roof fascia board/gable end vent directly above the room
4. There is no natural lighting and the downlights must be turned on even in daylight
5. The south east window onlooking the verandah extension cavity is pointless
6. The north most facing downlight frequently experiences flicker despite having change the globe


## Solution

1. Renew room and remove all unneccessary doors, walls, windows and closed spaces to create an open floor plan

## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLI-ISS-1|When inspecting the roof above the dining room it is clear that the fascia/gable end vent is barely holding together. Unlike the north facing roof fascia/gable end vent, I'm unsure whether this one would have been addressed as part of the upper level build?|


## Questions

* Is it possible to upgrade a ducted heating system to include cooling without complete replacement?
* Are there any issues with removing the north wall that covers the kithen pantry/cabinets? I kept it in these models because it is connected to the wall that is behind those same cabinet as part of the lounge.
