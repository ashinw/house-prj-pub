# Section DF - Main bathroom and Multi-level stair case

## Context

Section DF was originally the 3rd bedroom that was closest to the original bathroom. The new bathroom will now be relocated here in a slightly more accessible location.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Carpeted flooring
* Two downlights installed that operate through a dimmer transformer
* Two bedside lamps, one on the east wall and the other on the west wall
* A bulky wardrobe with a built-in study desk with shelves beside the wardrobe  
* A ducted heating vent by the north west wall
* A semi full-length old style window frame that matches the [window framing in the kitchen](./section-H-requirements.md)
* An external window blind to the west of the room
* Sheer and bulky pinch pleated curtains with thermo insulation lining


## Problem

1. There is a need for a central multi-level stair case in the new house design for conveniently navigating between floors and rooms in the house
2. The original room's built-in wardrobe & desk with shelves is bulky
3. The original room's wardrobe reduces the effective space of the room when opening and also conflicts with the room's entrance door
4. The room's door handle is completely broken 
5. There is no cooling system in this room
6. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
7. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate
8. The Symmetry principle will be violated because the laundry shall now be moved to the original main bathroom's location

Table LL-DF1: Floor plan comparison

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems|
|Symmetry with split occupancy|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|

Table LL-DF2: The design principles that should be influencing the solution's location/choices/decisions

### Steps

1. Partition the room into two to provide:
    1. The main bathroom 
    2. The multi-level stair case
2. Relocate the main bathroom in section DF 

### Considerations

1. LLDF-REQ20
    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected

## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLDF-ISS-1|The original [main bathroom](./section-A-requirements.md) is 11% larger than this space|
|LLDF-ISS-2|A large portion of the original large bedroom's window will need to be filled with rendered cladded foam. This will probably look very jarring from the outside|
