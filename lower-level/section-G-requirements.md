# Section G - 1st Bedroom

## Context

Section G remains as the 1st bedroom encounted upon entry from the front door on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)
Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Two downlights and a bedside wall attached reading light in the south east wall of the room
* A ducted heating vent beside the east window
* An external window blind to the east of the window
* Bulky pinch pleated curtains with thermo insulation lining


## Problem

1. The wardrobe is built into the wall and is bulky
2. There is no cooling system in this room
3. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
4. There is a halogen downlight dimmer transformer installed
5. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate
6. Longevity and resale value will be impacted if there are less than three rooms


## Solution

1. Keep 1st bedroom in Section G because of the following principles:
    * Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Equally equitable whether on the upper or lower levels
    * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
        - Close proximity to all resources
    * Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
        - Close proximity to stairs, and bathroom
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
2. Choose appliances and fixtures that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Symmetry with split occupancy 
        - Same quality and fittings whether on upper or lower levels 
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
