## Known issues

|---|---|
|LLG-ISS-1|The large window frames openings will likely need to be fiLLGd with foamed clad and rendered to achieve a similar look & feel to the upper level. Seek Brett's advice on window transition plan|
|LLG-ISS-2|The south most downlight experiences routine fault or flickering. I suspect that there is faulty wiring or housing|
