Figure LL2: TO-BE lower-level sections

There is/are:
* Two downlights and a bedside wall attached reading light in the south east wall of the room
* A ducted heating vent beside the east window
* An external blind to the east of the window
* A bulky pinch pleated curtains with thermo insulation lining

## Problem
1. The wardrobe is build into the wall and is bulky
2. There is no cooling system in this room
3. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
4. There is a halogen downlight dimmer transformer installed
5. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate

## Solution
1. Renew the entire bedroom and make it identical to the corresponding Upper Level bedroom. Note, all non-master bedrooms should be identical

## Known issues
|ID|Description|
|---|---|
|LLG-ISS-1|The large window frames openings will likely need to be fiLLGd with foamed clad and rendered to achieve a similar look & feel to the upper level. Seek Brett's advice on window transition plan|
|LLG-ISS-2|The south most downlight experiences routine fault or flickering. I suspect that there is fault in the wiring or the downlight housing|
