# Section G - 1st Bedroom

## Context

Section G remains as the 1st bedroom encounted upon entry from the front door on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)
Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Two downlights and a bedside wall attached reading light in the south east wall of the room
* A ducted heating vent beside the east window
* An external window blind to the east of the window
* Bulky pinch pleated curtains with thermo insulation lining


## Problem

1. The wardrobe is built into the wall and it is bulky
2. There is no cooling system in this room
3. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
4. There is a halogen downlight dimmer transformer installed
5. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate
6. Longevity and resale value will be impacted if there are less than three rooms

Note, although the bedroom will remain the same size, the furnishing sizes may vary and they need not remain the same (eg. window frame size, wardrobe & position of the downlights)

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|

### Considerations

    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected

|LLG-ISS-2|The south most facing downlight experiences routine faults or flickering. I suspect that there is a fault in the wiring or in the downlight housing|
