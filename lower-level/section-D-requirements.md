# Section D - Lower-level bathroom and Multi-level staircase

## Context

Section D was originally the 3rd bedroom that was situated south of the original bathroom location.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Carpeted flooring
* Two downlights installed that operate through a dimmer transformer
* Two bedside lamps, one on the east wall and the other on the west wall
* A bulky wardrobe with a built-in desk with shelves beside the wardrobe  
* A ducted heating vent by the north west wall
* A semi full-length old style window frame that matches the [window framing in the kitchen](./section-H-requirements.md)
* An external window blind to the west of the room
* Sheer and bulky pinch pleated curtains with thermo insulation lining


## Problem

1. There is a need for a central multi-level staircase in the new house design for conveniently navigating between floors and rooms in the house
2. The original room's built-in wardrobe & desk with shelves are bulky
3. The original room's wardrobe reduces the effective space of the room when opening and also conflicts with the room's entrance door
4. The room's door handle is completely broken 
5. There is no cooling system in this room
6. The current window frames are old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
7. The curtains are heavy and cumbersome to operate
8. Visitors would need to navigate to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|Fixtures and furnishings value function over form|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
|Reduce overall transit as the basis of location|
|Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems|

Table LL-D2: The design principles that should be influencing the solution's location/choices/decisions

### Steps

1. Partition the room into the following to provide:
    1. The bathroom
    2. An independent toilet
    3. The multi-level staircase

### Considerations

1. LLD-REQ20
    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected
2. Building Code Ceiling Heights
    - in a bathroom, shower room, laundry, sanitary compartment, pantry, storeroom, garage, car parking area etc - 2.1m and
    - in an attic, room with a sloping ceiling or projection below ceiling line or non-habitable room or similar - a height that does not unduly interfere with the proper functioning of the room or space. More than 50% of the ceiling space should be on average a minimum height.

## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLD-ISS-1|A large portion of the original large bedroom's window will need to be filled with rendered cladded foam. This will probably look very jarring from the outside|
|LLD-ISS-2|There are min height requirements that must be satisfied for a room with a slopping ceiling|
