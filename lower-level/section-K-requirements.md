# Section K - Lounge

## Context

Section K remains as the lounge area in the lower level as per the original floor plan.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Four downlights installed operating from a dimmer transformer
* A old style home theatre setup installed
* A sliding door & wall to the north to main entrance & hall
* A south facing sliding door to the verandah and deck
* A ducted heating vent beside the east window


## Problem

1. The horizontal stud behind the plaster board of the west wall [behind the kitchen cabinet](./section-H-requirements.md) is noticibly visible as the plaster board has bent around and following the contour of the stud 
2. There is no cooling system in this room but it gets some comfort from the [wall A/C in the adjacent dining room](./section-J-requirements.md)
3. The current window frame is old, large and difficult to open behind the fly screen
4. There are two UHF TV Antenna ports which connect to different external aerials (which are both installed at [the north side of the house](./section-A-requirements.md))
5. There are four cat5 ports that connect to the [original office room](./section-E-requirements.md)
6. There is 15+ year old projector installed on the ceiling with old RCA/VGA wiring that is connected to the bracket
7. There is a large projector screen installed on the east side above the window
8. In the summer, heat enters the room through the large windows on the east and the large windows on the south sliding doors to the deck. There is a lot of afternoon light reflected from the fencing on the east
9. There is a halogen downlight dimmer transformer installed
10. The north-east most facing downlight frequently experiences flicker despite having change the globe
11. Inequity will arise if there are differences in size, quality and positioning between upper and lower levels


## Solution

1. Keep the lounge room in Section K because of the following principles:
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
        - Lounge areas are often highly utilised areas in the house
    * Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
        - Lounge areas can pull in the space and resources of the dining area
    * Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Equally equitable whether on the upper or lower levels
2. Choose window positions & sizes that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
        - West facing windows invite a lot of heat/sun
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Externally matches the rest of the build structures
    4. No maintenance over low/some maintenance

1. Remove all old technology, wiring and/ore housing
2. Use double glazzed windows on all large windowing surfaces

## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLK-ISS-1|Brett to advice how window/frame consistency can be achieved between levels|
|LLK-ISS-2|Need to investigate whether we dedicate one TV aerial per level as there is no signal repeaters installed and splitting reduces the signal strength. Note, there are currently four splitting points already installed throughout the house|
