# Section A - Main bathroom [Resource]

## Context

Section A remains as the main bathroom on the lower level.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* A single downlight installed
* A ducted heating outlet
* A tiled floor
* No better place for a backdoor/outdoor exit point at near ground level than on the north wall of this room  


## Problem

1. Refer to [laundry related problems](./section-H-requirements.md#Problem) that are captured in section H
2. Visitors would need to navigate to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom
3. Both upper & lower level residents require an area for washing and hanging clothes with convenient access to the clothes line
4. Brett has advised that it is cost prohibitive to move the laundry into this location due to all the plumbing work (particularly the toilet). It is significantly cheaper to keep the bathroom here and use a slopped deck instead.

|Fixtures and furnishings value function over form|
|No maintenance over low/some maintenance|
