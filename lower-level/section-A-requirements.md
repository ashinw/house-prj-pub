# Section A - Laundry [Shared Resource]

## Context

Section A was originally the main bathroom which is 1.5x bigger that the original laundry. The laundry will now be relocated to Section A at the far north west of the house beside the outdoor clothes line.

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* A single downlight installed
* A ducted heating outlet
* A tiled floor
* No better place for a backdoor/outdoor exit point at near ground level than on the north wall of this room  


## Problem

1. Refer to [laundry related problems](./section-H-requirements.md#Problem) that are captured in section H
2. Visitors would need to navigate to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom
3. Both upper & lower level residents require an area for washing and hanging clothes with convenient access to the clothes line

### Steps

1. Relocate the [main bathroom](./section-DF-requirements.md) from Section A to Section DF
2. Relocate the [laundry](./section-H-requirements.md) from Section H to Section A
3. Move the back door to the north end of the house such that it is now beside the clothes line  
4. Create [step down](../landscape/section-U-requirements.md) to ground level as part of Section U

### Considerations

1. LLA-REQ4
    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected


## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLA-ISS-1|The outside tap on the north wall brickwork will need to be re-located about 1m to the east to clear space for the external sliding door|
|LLA-ISS-2|The frame for the external sliding must be less than 1.7m due to room width|
