# Section A

## Context
Section A was the Main Bathroom in the original floor plan.

There is/are:
* A single downlight installed
* A ducted heating outlet
* An ideal backdoor outdoor exit point to near ground level on the north wall  

## Problem
1. The laundry in the original floor plan was too small
2. The door outside the laundry is 1.2m off the ground and the stairs are old and weathered and therefore, the laundry is hung on the clothes line outside via the main entrance
3. Visitors would need to navigate to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom

## Solution
1. Move the laundry to where the main bathroom was
2. Move the back door such that it is now a single step outside to level ground beside the clothes line
