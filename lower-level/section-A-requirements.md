# Section A - Laundry [Shared Resource]

## Context

Section A was originally the main bathroom which is 1.5x bigger that the original laundry. The laundry will now be relocated to Section A at the far north west of the house beside the outdoor clothes line.

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* A single downlight installed
* A ducted heating outlet
* a tiled floor
* No better place for a backdoor/outdoor exit point at ground level than on the north wall in this room  


## Problem

1. Refer to [laundry related problems](./section-H-requirements.md#Problem) that are captured in section H
2. Visitors would need to navigate to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom
3. Both upper & lower level residents require a convenient area for washing and hanging clothes


## Solution

1. Relocate laundry in Section A because of the following principles:
    * Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
        - External clothes line is directly outside
    * Reduce overall transit as the basis of location
        - The burden of carrying laundry loads over distance is reduced
    * Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
        - In winter: With an internal drying rack and a ducted heating vent, clothes can dry well in this closed space
        - In summer: With an internal drying rack and the windows open, clothes can dry well in this closed space 
2. Choose sliding door, window position & size, and laundry fixtures that satisfy the following principles in order:
    1. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
        - West facing windows invite a lot of heat/sun
    2. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
    3. Symmetry with split occupancy
        - Externally matches the rest of the build structures
    4. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
3. Move the [laundry](./section-H-requirements.md) to this location and, move the [main bathroom](./section-DF-requirements.md) beside this room
4. Move the back door such that it is now a single step outside to level ground beside the clothes line
