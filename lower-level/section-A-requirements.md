# Section A - Laundry

## Context

Section A will become the laundry located in the north west corner in the house where the main bathroom is currently located. The [main bathroom](./section-D-requirements.md) will be moved to section D.

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* A single downlight installed
* A ducted heating outlet
* A tiled floor
* No better place for a backdoor/outdoor exit point at near ground level than on the north wall of this room  


## Problem

1. Refer to [laundry related problems](./section-F-requirements.md#Problem) that are captured in section F
2. Visitors would need to walk to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom
3. Both upper & lower level residents require an area for washing and hanging clothes with convenient access to the clothes line
4. Brett has advised that it is cost prohibitive to move the laundry into this location due to all the plumbing work (particularly the toilet). He believes that it is significantly cheaper to keep the bathroom here and move the [laundry to section D](./section-D-requirements.md) using a slopped deck for outside access. 
    * Note, this solution too is problematic with all the external plumbing would be covered by the deck and would need to be removed should problems arise.
    * I have discussed Brett's plumbing concerns with Tim who believes that there will be no significant cost related to moving the plumbing
