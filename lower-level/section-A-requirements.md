## Context
Section A was the Main bathroom in the original floor plan.

![TO-BE lower-level diagram](Lower-Level-TO-BE-sections.svg)

Figure LL2: TO-BE lower-level sections

There is/are:
* A single downlight installed
* A ducted heating outlet
* No better ideal backdoor/outdoor exit point at ground level than on the north wall in this room  

## Problem
1. Refer to [laundry related problems](./section-H-requirements.md#Problem) that are captured in section H
2. Visitors would need to navigate to the far end of the house to go to the bathroom

## Solution
1. Move the [laundry](./section-H-requirements.md) to this location and, move the [main bathroom](./section-DF-requirements.md) beside this
2. Move the back door such that it is now a single step outside to level ground beside the clothes line
