# Section H - Kitchen

## Context

Section H was originally the combined meals area and kitchen on the lower level. The meals area has been replaced by the dining room and the island kitchen bench. The kitchen has been extended southward into the original [dining area in section J](./section-J-requirements.md).

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* Three downlights installed in the kitchen
* A Bosch instant hot water system installed outside on the west side. The system is about 15yo 
* A Braemar heating system installed outside on the west side. This system is about 5+yo 
* A man hole accessible on the west side ceiling in the laundry
* A lot of large windows that absorb the summer sun
* An external window blind to the west of the kitchen
* A fridge with water and ice dispenser that is connected to plumbing on the east side installed in the allocated cavity in the cabinet
* A ceiling to floor pantry in the south east section of the cabinet
* Many cabinets as part of the kitchen under benches, over/under stove etc


## Problem

1. In summer this whole western section is almost unbearable. It's the hottest area in the house even with the external kitchen window blind down and all the night/day blockout blinds closed
2. The external kitchen window frames are weathered from the climate and barely holding together
3. Although the kitchen has a more modern (24 years ago) design, its south west cooking & preperation area is too cramped for even a single cook
4. The large fridge sticks out by approx 10+cm 
5. The meals area table and the dining room table are frequently used as additional workspace and preperation area
7. The large window built into the laundry door lets a lot of sun/heat in
8. [Electrical surges are encountered](./section-I-requirements.md) and the breaker trips when using a certain combination of appliances in the kitchen/lounge/dining room

Table LL-H1: Floor plan comparison

|Design principles|
|:---|
|Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing|
|Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems|
|Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another|
|Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others|

Table LL-H2: The design principles that should be influencing the solution's location/choices/decisions


### Steps
1. Create a more open space by removing walls and cabinets that occupy **central** areas
2. Replace full length larger windows with a more appropriate temperature managed window solution to manage the impact of the western sun/heat
3. Move plumbing inlet tap for fridge's ice/water dispenser
5. Create more spacing between stove and sink
6. Replace and install new stove, rangehood and oven 

### Considerations

1. LLH-REQ1
    - Subject to the decision on centralised heating & cooling option selected

## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLH-ISS-1|There is a known defect with the Bosch instant hot water system that occurs only under very cold conditions. Under such conditions the gas inlet somehow gets blocked. This starves the system of fuel and cuts all hot water flow to the house (ie. no water comes out of the hot water taps). The solution is to reboot the system by opening and closing the gas inlet valve and reseting the power. Because, we know the workaround it is not necessary to replace it yet|
