# Section H - Kitchen [Shared Resource]

## Context

Section H was original the combined laundry, meals area and kitchen on the lower level. The kitchen has now been extended to occupy both the meals and the laundry areas.

Figure LL2: Expected layout

There is/are currently:
* A single globe light (ie. non-downlight) inside for the laundry
* A single globe light (ie. non-downlight) outside the laundry for the backyard stair case
* A Bosch instant hot water system installed outside on the west side. The system is about 15yo 
* A Braemar heating system installed outside on the west side. This system is about 5+yo 
* Two downlights installed in the meals
* Three downlights installed in the kitchen
* The linen cupboard is built into the walls on the east of the laundry
* A laundry stair case to the backyard is 1.2m above ground level 
* A man hole accessible on the west side ceiling in the laundry
* A lot of large windows that absorb the summer sun
* A ducted heating vent on the west side of meals area 
* An external window blind to the west of the kitchen
* A fridge with water and ice dispenser that is connected to plumbing on the east side installed in the allocated cavity in the cabinet
* A ceiling to floor pantry in the south east section of the cabinet
* Many cabinets as part of the kitchen under benches, over/under stove etc


## Problem

1. In summer this whole western section is almost unbearable. It's the hostest area in the house even with the external kitchen window blind down and all the night/day blockout blinds closed
2. The external window frames are weathered from the climate and barely holding together
3. Although the kitchen has a more modern (24 years ago) design, its south west cooking & preperation area is too cramped for even a single cook
4. The large fridge sticks out by approx 10+cm 
5. The meals area table and the dining room table are frequently used as additional workspace and preperation area
6. The laundry is too small despite having the dryer installed above the top loader washing machine
7. There is an unusually loud hammering with respect to plumbing in the house. This is typically observable when toilets are flushed, showers turned on/off, washing machine operates
8. The large window built into the laundry door lets a lot of sun/heat in
9. The wooden 1.2m high stair case outside the laundry is very weathered from climate and is becoming dangerous to use, thus the laundry is hung on the clothes line outside via the main front door entrance. Thereore, the [laundry is better placed near ground level](./section-A-requirements.md)
10. [Electrical surges are encountered](./section-I-requirements.md) and the breaker trips when using a certain combination of appliances in the kitchen/lounge/dining room


## Solution

1. Move the laundry to the north side of the house where its almost ground level and beside the clothes line
2. Create a more open space by removing walls and cabinets that occupy **central** areas
3. Replace full length larger windows with shorter wider ones to reduce the impact of the western sun/heat
4. Create more spacing between stove and sink

## Known issues

|ID|Description|
|:---|:---|
|LLH-ISS-1|There is a known defect with the Bosch instant hot water system that occurs only under very cold conditions. Under such conditions the gas inlet somehow gets blocked. This starves the system of fuel and cuts all hot water flow to the house (ie. no water comes out of the hot water taps). The solution is to reboot the system by opening and closing the gas inlet valve and reseting the power. Because, we know the workaround it is not necessary to replace it yet|
