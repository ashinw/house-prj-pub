# Camellia Ct Split Occupancy - Project Requirements Specification

This repository has been setup to collaborate with Brett (Architect) and Tim/Andre (Builders). I have chosen you guys specifically because I believe that you guys are the best team to help me achieve the **greatest bang for buck**, even if that means abandoning the project and buying a new house. 
* Brett 
  * I believe Brett knows his shit and is capable of making some significant architectural/design choices that can significantly reduce the costs of build and on-going operation costs (eg. heating/cooling) 
* Tim/Andre
  * I have been engaging Tim/Andre throughout this process because I'm confident that they will deliver me a build that is atleast 15+% cheaper for the same materials and quality of workmanship as any other builder. 

In this respository you will find the full set of customer requirements for this project. These requirements will be found in the individually linked pages. Each requirement has been organised into the following categories:
1. Lower-level [LL]
2. Upper-level [UL]
3. Outer-building [OB]
4. Landscaping [LS] 

Each category will be further classified and uniquely identified as a particular feature (eg. OB-LLMB.1 may refer to the requirements that the external window sun blind should be removed for the lower-level master bedroom). Each requirement will be documented as both an ID and a description in a table and should be costed.

My dad, sister, wife, my kids and I will then assess the priority of those requirements in terms of the estimated cost. This will inform us on best to proceed with this project.

Please note:
* All diagrams and models in this repository have been modeled by me! They have been modeled to get us all on the same page and understand the scope of this project. These models will serve as a source of input for the deliverables that Brett produces. Hence, they are a starting point of which I suspect you all will see glaring enhancements through your direct experiences.
* I have attempted to model all aspects because of the inherent inter-relationship of the features (eg. in order to quote on the lower-level renovation, you need to speculate where the staircase is to get to the upper-level and the removable of walls to accomodate it)
* Where possible I have also identified known issues below the requirements to draw your attention to a concern that may affect the design and/or cost estimation.
* In order for Tim/Andre to provide an accurate quote on the entire project scope, they need engineering specfications. In order to get the engineering specifications Brett needs to have submitted his building plans/working drawings to the engaged Structural Engineer. Therefore, in order for my family to finalise our prioritised build scope based on costings, we will likely need a process that round-trips with the Structural Engineer most likely two times. 
* My family have tasked me with finding a way to make every cent sunk into this project yield its greatest value. Please let me know if there are things that you recommend that I do in order to reduce your workload such that I can reduce our overral costs during scope finalisation.
* It's important to realise that this project is financed through different funding stakeholders in my family. Eg. we may decide based on Tim/Andres quote to include a 3rd bedroom, dining & lounge features in the upper-level. Hence, the budget may get extended to $250K if the value proposition is there.
* The 1st model that I want fully costed is a "Split occupancy design". This split occupancy concept is designed to give family groups greater autonomy whilst still sharing critical services like kitchen and laundry.  
* I would really appreciate you collaborating with me and each other on how things can be done better and cheaper!

## Design principles
1. Satisfy budget (I value function over form factor)
2. No maintenance over low/some maintenance (eg. we have no interest in gardening etc)
3. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
4. Embrace value for money & higher quality if premium is just 20% more than standard pricing (eg your double glazing case)
5. Accessibility and position of features is intuitive and not cumbersome (eg stair case)
6. Consider resale

## Requirements
1. [Lower-Level requirements](./lower-level/Lower-Level-requirements.md)




These are ONLY just my thoughts and models that I intend share with Brett! This repository can be used by Brett and myself to review any/all revisions of documentation or models that I have authored and published. Put simply it is less error prone than collaborating via email.

## Requirements
The wishlist is as follows:
- accommodation for dad & sister
  - 1 main bedroom w/ ensuite
  - 1 small bedroom
  - 1 leasure area
  - 1 extra toilet
- kitchen reno (no workspace in current kitchen for wife, daughter and sister to all cook together)
- general house reno incl:
  - bathrooms reno
  - fix up water pressure and hammering
  - fix up electricity from tripping/surges
  - fix outdated windows/wardrobes/doors/carpets around house


## Known issues with current configuration (ie. pain points)
1. kitchen workspace is too small for collaboration and non-trivial preparations 
2. lack of natural light in dining room (need to turn lights on almost all the time)
3. summer sun
    * morning summer sun from the east  through the window next to the main entry causes the hallway to become very hot
    * evening summer sun from the west through the kitchen, meals area and laundry causes those respective areas to become extremely hot
4. laundry back door next to sink is too difficult to exit from and also too high (1.2m) from the ground. Thus, it is not really used
5. driveway is 2.24m wide between corner of house and fence and thus the carport is not used (thinking about repurposing this as a more secluded outdoor area)
6. both north and south triangular regions of the property are mostly unused (thinking about putting an secondary driveway at the southen end)
7. there is only a single window/wall aircon in the dining room
8. Rumpus/meditation room (almost 1m drop) is typically 2-4 degrees colder than rest of house (good in the summer, but very cold in winter)
