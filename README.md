# Camellia Ct Split Occupancy - Project Requirements Specification

This repository has been setup to collaborate with Brett (Architect) and Tim/Andre (Builders). I have chosen you guys specifically because I believe that you guys are the best team to help me achieve the **greatest bang for buck**, even if that means abandoning the project and buying a new house. 
* Brett 
  * I believe Brett knows his shit and is capable of making some significant architectural/design choices that can significantly reduce the costs of build and on-going operation costs (eg. heating/cooling) 
* Tim/Andre
  * I have been engaging Tim/Andre throughout this process because I'm confident that they will deliver me a build that is atleast 15+% cheaper for the same materials and quality of workmanship than any other builder. 

In this respository you will find the full set of customer requirements for this project. These requirements will be found in the individually linked pages. Each requirement has been organised into the following categories:
1. Lower-level [LL]
2. Upper-level [UL]
3. Landscaping [LS]
4. Outer-building [OB] **NOT MODELED YET**

Each category will be further classified and uniquely identified as a particular feature (eg. LLK refers to the requirements associated with lower-level lounge section). Each requirement will be documented as both an ID and a description in a table and should be costed individually if possible. Your costings will enable us to prioritise which features will form part of the final scope. All of these requirements are aspects of the property that need attention. Ideally, we can achieve them all within a big budget but if not we need to assess which ones to drop. 

My dad, sister, wife, my kids and I will assess the priority of those requirements in terms of your estimated cost. This will inform us on how best to proceed with this project.

Please note:
* All diagrams and models in this repository have been modeled by me! They have been modeled to get us all on the same page and understand the scope of this project. These models will serve as a source of input for the deliverables that Brett produces. Hence, they are a starting point of which I suspect you all will see glaring home improvements to make through your direct experiences.
* All measurements in the "Actual" views were recorded in cm and represent my best efforts. I recommend using these measurements as a guide **ONLY** and use Brett's measurements as authoratative when he comes here.
* All position of building fixtures are to scale in the "Actual" view and predicted to be to scale in the "Expected" model 
* I have attempted to model all aspects because of the inherent inter-relationship of the features (eg. in order to quote on the lower-level renovation, there are assumptions on where the stair case is going to be to get to the upper-level and the removal of walls to accomodate it)
* Where possible I have also identified known issues below the requirements to draw your attention to a concern that may affect the design and/or cost estimation.
* On several requirements sections I have documented questions which affect decisions. I would appreciate your responses to these questions.
* In order for Tim/Andre to provide an accurate quote on the entire project scope, Tim indicated that he needs engineering specfications. In order to get the engineering specifications Brett needs to have submitted his building plans/working drawings to the engaged Structural Engineer. Therefore, in order for my family to finalise our prioritised build scope based on costings, we will likely need a process that round-trips with the Structural Engineer most likely two times. Brett, believes that Tim/Andre will be able to provide a solid quote without the need for the engineering specification because there will be sufficient specifications documented in his deliverables. Tim please clarify with Brett.
* My family have tasked me with finding a way to make every cent sunk into this project yield its greatest value. Please let me know if there are things that you recommend that I do in order to reduce your workload such that I can reduce our overrall costs during scope finalisation and build.
* It's important to realise that this project is financed through different funding stakeholders in my family. I have documented all the requirements indicating that the stakeholders may extend the budget to $250K if the value proposition is there.
* The 1st model that I want fully costed is a "Split occupancy design". This split occupancy concept is designed to give two family groups (one upstairs and the other downstairs) greater autonomy whilst still sharing critical services like kitchen and laundry.  
* I would really appreciate you collaborating with me and each other on how things can be done better and cheaper!


## Design principles

There are design principles that I have used to govern my architectural choices, and design decisions. They should equally inform your options with respect to architecture, design, fixtures, furnishings and other build related decisions and considerations. 

1. Embrace value for money first, but select premium if just 20% more than standard pricing
2. No maintenance over low/some maintenance
3. Embrace natural lighting and reduce demand on heating/cooling systems
4. Fixtures and furnishings value function over form 
5. Symmetry with split occupancy will likely result in greater longevity (ie. resale)
6. Centralise shared building services/resources over decentralisation
7. Rooms/resources that are used together should be adjacent to one another
8. Rooms/resources that are frequented in terms of time spent/people should attract more space/investment than others
9. Reduce overall transit as the basis of location


## Symmetry

There is an intentional architectural symmetry across both levels. That is, most room configurations are mirrored in size, position and characteristics. In terms of personal space both levels occupy the same functional total surface area, thus making each level equally equitable for future tenants/families to split in order to cohabit the dwelling.
